# This is a general template for creating models.
#
# To build your own model, extend class ABM.Model supplying the
# two abstract methods `setup` and `step`.  `@foo` signifies
# an instance variable or method.
# See [CoffeeScript docs](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/#classes)
# for explanation of context of a class and its constructor.
#
# We do not provide a constructor of our own.
# CoffeeScript automatically calls `Model.constructor <args>`
# and `setup` will be called by `Model.constructor`. See:
#
#     model = new MyModel "layers", 13, -16, 16, -16, 16
#
# below, which passes all its arguments to `Model`

u = ABM.util # ABM.util alias, u.s is also ABM.shapes accessor.
log = (arg) -> console.log arg
class MyModel extends ABM.Model
  # `startup` initializes resources used by `setup` and `step`.
  # This is called by the constructor which waits for all files
  # processed by `starup`.  Useful for large files, but here just
  # for an example, not needed by simple models.
  startup: -> # called by constructor
    # Add new shapes; u.s. is ABM.shapes.
    u.s.add "bowtie", true, (c) -> u.s.poly c, [[-.5,-.5],[.5,.5],[-.5,.5],[.5,-.5]]
    # The following two example lines don't work when opened locally
    # in Chrome (they work fine from a webserver). Uncomment if you'd
    # like to add custom images.

    # u.s.add "cc", true, u.importImage("data/coffee.png")

    # u.s.add "redfish", false, u.importImage("data/redfish64t.png")

  # Initialize our model via the `setup` abstract method.
  # This model simply creates `population` agents with
  # arbitrary shapes with `size` size and `speed` velocity.
  # We also periodically change the patch colors to random gray values.

    # Our empty @agents AgentSet will have been created.  Here we
    # add `population` Agents we use in our model.
    # We set the build-in Agent variables `size` and `shape`
    # and layout the agents randomly or in a circle depending
    # on our modeel's `startCircle` variable.
